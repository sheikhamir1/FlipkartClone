Hello, this is Sheikh Amir, and I have created a clone of Flipkart. It's a simple Flipkart project that I built using React.js. Currently, it's only the main page of Flipkart. In the future, I plan to add a sign-in page and develop the backend to allow users to log in and provide reviews, primarily for testing purposes.
This webpage is fully responsive
